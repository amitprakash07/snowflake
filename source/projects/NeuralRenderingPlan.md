Neural Rendering Roadmap (Augustâ€“January)

Month 1: Foundations & Orientation
- Study deep learning and computer graphics fundamentals
- Complete CS231n lectures and MIT 6.837 basics
- Set up environment: PyTorch, JAX, GPU/Colab
- Explore PyTorch3D and synthetic 3D scene creation

Month 2: Neural Rendering Fundamentals
- Read and understand the NeRF paper (Mildenhall et al.)
- Implement a basic NeRF model
- Visualize novel views from synthetic Blender data

Month 3: Advanced Techniques
- Explore Instant-NGP for fast NeRF training
- Review papers like Zip-NeRF and DreamFusion
- Experiment with dynamic scenes and lighting variations

Month 4: Signature Project
- Build a stylized rendering pipeline (e.g. text-to-scene)
- Integrate CLIP-guided style transfer, object relighting
- Create GitHub repo with visuals and documentation

Month 5: Research & Networking
- Dive into implicit representations and generative renderers
- Explore IP and ethics of neural-generated content
- Engage in CVPR/Reddit/Discord communities

Month 6: Polish & Presentation
- Optimize model and benchmark performance
- Prepare a lightning talk or blog post
- Practice technical interview answers around rendering
